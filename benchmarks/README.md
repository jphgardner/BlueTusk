# BlueTusk benchmarks

The BenchmarkDotNet suite covers protocol parsing/writing and type codecs today. Connection, pooling, reader, COPY, replication, EF materialisation, and graph workloads are added alongside those implementations.

Run the complete suite in Release mode:

```powershell
dotnet run --project benchmarks/BlueTusk.Benchmarks -c Release
```

For a shorter development run:

```powershell
dotnet run --project benchmarks/BlueTusk.Benchmarks -c Release -- --job short
```

Markdown and brief JSON reports are written below `artifacts/benchmarks` by default. Set `BLUETUSK_BENCHMARK_ARTIFACTS` to redirect them. Checked-in results below `benchmarks/baselines` document one named reference environment; they are evidence and comparison inputs, not universal performance promises.
