Captured on 2026-07-21 with:

- BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8
- Windows 11 10.0.26200.8894
- AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 8 physical / 16 logical cores
- .NET SDK 10.0.110 and .NET runtime 10.0.10
- x64 RyuJIT with workstation concurrent GC

Command:

```powershell
$env:BLUETUSK_BENCHMARK_ARTIFACTS = "benchmarks/baselines/windows-ryzen7-5800x-dotnet10"
dotnet run --project benchmarks/BlueTusk.Benchmarks -c Release -- --job short --filter '*'
```

The checked-in GitHub Markdown reports are human-readable; the brief JSON reports support automated comparison. A short job has only three measured iterations and is a development reference, not a universal performance guarantee or a substitute for release-grade runs.

The frontend-writer report was regenerated after removing interface-enumerator allocations from extended Bind messages. Both simple and extended writer workloads report zero managed allocation per operation.
